		<h3>Welcome to the PC "Master Race".</h3>

		<p>
			This is a game developed during the Rich Animation class. You "race" as far as you can to get a high score.
			Your health affects the game's FPS (frames-per-second). The lower the life, the more "lag" you experience.
			The higher your life, the more "smooth" you experience (depending on your PC specs).
		</p>
